# 🛒 ecommerce — Capstone

The final project — a production-style e-commerce event pipeline
that uses all three messaging systems for what each does best.

## Monitoring Stack

This app is fully instrumented with Spring Boot Actuator,
Micrometer, and Prometheus. A Grafana dashboard visualizes
all metrics in real time.

```
Spring Boot App → /actuator/prometheus → Prometheus → Grafana
```

## Why Each System Is Used Here

| System   | Consumer          | Reason                                       |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Kafka    | Inventory Service | High volume, needs replay capability         |
| Kafka    | Analytics Service | Same events, completely independent group    |
| RabbitMQ | Email Service     | Job queue — deliver once, process once       |
| RabbitMQ | SMS Service       | Independent from email via fanout exchange   |
| SQS      | Invoice Generator | AWS-native pattern, serverless in production |

---

## Patterns Demonstrated

### Idempotency across all systems
One `messageId` (UUID) generated at order placement.
Stamped on every Kafka message, RabbitMQ message, and SQS message.
Any consumer seeing the same `messageId` twice can safely skip.

### Consumer group independence (Kafka)
`InventoryConsumer` uses `ecommerce-inventory-group`.
`AnalyticsConsumer` uses `ecommerce-analytics-group`.
Both receive every order event — neither knows the other exists.

### Fanout independence (RabbitMQ)
`EmailConsumer` and `SmsConsumer` are bound to the same fanout exchange.
If email sending fails, SMS is unaffected — separate queues.

### Pull-based SQS vs push-based Kafka/RabbitMQ
Kafka and RabbitMQ push messages to consumers.
SQS requires consumers to poll — `InvoiceConsumer` runs a polling loop.
In production, AWS Lambda handles this automatically.

## How to Run

Start all infrastructure first:

```bash
# terminal 1 — Kafka
docker compose -f docker/kafka-compose.yml up -d

# terminal 2 — RabbitMQ
docker compose -f docker/rabbit-compose.yml up -d

# terminal 3 — LocalStack
docker compose -f docker/localstack-compose.yml up -d

# Start the monitoring stack
docker compose -f docker/monitoring-compose.yml up -d

# verify all are healthy
docker ps
```

Then start the app:

```bash
cd capstone/ecommerce
mvn spring-boot:run
```

App starts on port **8088**.

---

## Place an Order

### Health check

```
curl http://localhost:8088/actuator/health
```

Shows status of Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and disk space.
All components should show UP before placing orders.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orderId": "ORD-001",
    "customerId": "CUST-001",
    "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
    "customerPhone": "+91-9999999999",
    "amount": 2500.00,
    "items": "Laptop Stand, USB Hub, Mousepad"
  }'
```

## What You Should See in Logs

Within 3 seconds of placing the order:
```
OrderEventPublisher | Publishing order event | messageId: abc-123
KAFKA    | published | partition: 1 | offset: 0
RABBITMQ | published to fanout exchange
SQS      | published to invoice queue

INVENTORY | received | items: Laptop Stand, USB Hub, Mousepad
INVENTORY | deducting stock...

ANALYTICS | received | revenue: 2500.0 | customer: CUST-001
ANALYTICS | recording...

EMAIL | sending confirmation | to: customer@example.com
EMAIL | sent and ACKed
SMS | sending | to: +91-9999999999 | message: 'Order ORD-001 placed...'
SMS | sent and ACKed

INVOICE | generating | invoiceNo: INV-ORD-001 | amount: ₹2500.0
INVOICE | generated and deleted from SQS
```

All five consumers respond to a single order placement.

## Grafana Dashboard

Open http://localhost:3000 → Dashboards → Queue Dockyard

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds and shows:
- Order pipeline throughput across all 5 consumers
- Publish duration p50/p95/p99
- Duplicate message detection count
- JVM heap memory and thread counts
- HTTP request rate and latency

## Configuration

| Property                     | Value                              | Description        |

## Production Hardening Applied

| Pattern             | Implementation                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Health checks       | Spring Boot Actuator `/actuator/health`             |
| Metrics exposure    | Micrometer + Prometheus at `/actuator/prometheus`   |
| Redis idempotency   | `RedisIdempotencyStore` replaces in-memory store    |
| Business metrics    | `MetricsService` — counters and timers per consumer |
| Publish duration    | Timer wrapping all three system publishes           |
| Duplicate detection | Counter incremented when duplicate messageId found  |
